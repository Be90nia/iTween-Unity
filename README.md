# iTween

iTween can be used with all scripting languages that Unity supports including JavaScript, 
C# and Boo. To install iTween create a folder named "Plugins" in your project's assets 
(if you are using C# the location of iTween does not matter as long as it is inside your assets folder).

## Important Notes

This is an unofficial Unity package compatible with UPM, maintained by @route1rodent.

If you need the latest updates, you can also install the regular plugin via the 
[official Asset Store page](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/itween-84).

The `iTween.cs` is provided unchanged, as-it-is in the official project,
but this repository may add new C# scripts to complement or extend it features.

This repository uses SemVer tag versioning, but the version of this repository only represents
the Unity package version and not the iTween official project version, so they are independent
and different.

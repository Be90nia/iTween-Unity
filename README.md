## Important Notes

If you need the latest updates, you can also install the plugin using the
[official Asset Store plugin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/itween-84).

The `iTween.cs` is provided as-it-is, unchanged from the official project,
but this repository may add new C# scripts to complement or extend it features.

This repository uses SemVer tag versioning. The SemVer releases and tags of this repository
only represents the Unity package version and not the `iTween.cs` library version.
